	<ul>
		<li>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you solve them?</li>
		<p>
			Basically, not too many troubles prevent me from finishing this assignment, because I have found some powerful websites to help me build a easy layout of my index page. I think the hardest challenge is to load image by correct path and post my index.html on website. Steps to solve:
			<ol>
				<li>Add fundimental elements, like "html", "head", "body", to my home page.</li>
				<li>Add two layers to contain blog link and personal descriptions.</li>
				<li>Add a table to format basic frame of my description, including combine 3 rows to show my profile image.</li>
				<li>After doing all things, I try to post my webpage but it is not successful at beginning. However, I can see my index page after I send email to Computer Help Desk for help.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<li>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
		<p>Mainly, I have learned how to post my personal webpage online. I have known quite a few basic elements to build a basic webpage.</p>
		<li>What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
		<p>I use these two websites: "http://www.runoob.com/html/html-tutorial.html" and "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp". There are some specific descriptions of all html elements and also both websites give some relevant examples to demostrate. I can run those sample code and build my works.</p>
