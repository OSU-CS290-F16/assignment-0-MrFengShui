			<b>DESCRIPTION: </b>When I was in childhood, I met a shameless thing. One day, I was ready to ride my bike to go somewhere. When I started to ride my bike, there were a pair of young man and woman stopping their bikes and began to kiss. At that time, all people seeing this scene felt embarrassed. I thought whethor it was necessary for them to kiss at that moment or not. They could choose to some corners to solve their problems.
